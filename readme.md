## TMDB CLI Tool

### Project URL: 
https://roadmap.sh/projects/tmdb-cli

In this project, you will build a simple command line interface (CLI) to fetch data from The Movie Database (TMDB) and display it in the terminal. This project will help you practice your programming skills, including working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building a simple CLI application.

### Requirements:

The application should run from the command line, and be able to pull and show the popular, top-rated, upcoming and now playing movies from the TMDB API. The user should be able to specify the type of movies they want to see by passing a command line argument to the CLI tool.

### Example:
```
tmdb-app --type "playing"
tmdb-app --type "popular"
tmdb-app --type "top"
tmdb-app --type "upcoming"
```
